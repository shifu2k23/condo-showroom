You are a senior Laravel engineer. Extend an Airbnb-like Laravel + Livewire app with:
- Laravel (latest stable)
- Livewire (latest stable)
- Laravel default auth exists for ADMIN only
- Pest for tests

Goal:
1) PUBLIC showroom shows rooms/units and availability.
2) When a unit is rented for a period, the public showroom must show the unit as “RENTED” for that period WITHOUT showing renter names.
3) Renters must be able to access a Renter Dashboard WITHOUT creating an account and WITHOUT Gmail login.
4) Renters must be able to submit maintenance tickets (cleaning, clogged sink/CR, etc.).
5) Renter access must EXPIRE automatically when their rental period ends. After expiry, renter “login” must be unavailable and show a professional message.

ABSOLUTE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Never expose API keys/secrets client-side (Blade/Livewire/JS).
- Store secrets only in .env/config.
- If OCR/ID scanning is used, it MUST be server-side only. The frontend must not call OCR providers directly.
- Do not store raw ID images publicly; store in private storage and serve via signed temporary URLs if needed.
- Do not log secrets or sensitive ID numbers.

========================================================
A) RENTAL PERIOD + PUBLIC “RENTED” DISPLAY
========================================================
Add concept of Rentals/Bookings that represent actual stays (not only viewing requests).

Public showroom:
- A unit can be AVAILABLE or RENTED for specific dates.
- The public UI must show:
   - “RENTED” badge when current date is within an active rental period
   - Optionally show “Rented until {date}” but NEVER show renter name, contact, or ID.

Rules:
- Availability for a given date range is computed from rentals:
   - If any CONFIRMED rental overlaps requested range => not available.
- Current “now” status on public card:
   - If now overlaps an active CONFIRMED rental => badge RENTED
   - Else AVAILABLE

========================================================
B) RENTER ACCESS WITHOUT TRADITIONAL ACCOUNTS
========================================================
Renters do NOT create accounts and do NOT use email login.
Instead, create a “Renter Access” mechanism based on:
- Renter name + selected valid ID type + ID verification reference
- After verification, renter receives an access method that does not require email/password.

REQUIREMENT:
- Provide a public page button “Renter Access” (NOT “Login” in the traditional sense).
- Flow:
  1) Renter enters:
     - Full Name (string)
     - Valid ID type (dropdown: Passport, Driver’s License, National ID, etc.)
     - Valid ID number OR last 4 digits (choose privacy-friendly approach)
     - Optional: Date of birth (optional)
     - Optional: Rental reference code (recommended)
  2) System verifies renter against an existing CONFIRMED rental record.
  3) If match and rental is still active (today <= end_date), grant access to Renter Dashboard.
  4) If rental has ended (today > end_date), deny access with professional message:
     “Access unavailable. Our records show there is no active rental under these details. If you believe this is an error, please contact the front desk.”

IMPORTANT SECURITY DESIGN:
- Do NOT implement a “weak login” by name only.
- Use at least TWO factors from:
  - rental reference code (best)
  - ID type + ID number (or partial) that matches rental record
  - phone number (optional)
- Do NOT expose renter PII in public routes.
- Rate limit access attempts per IP.

SESSION DESIGN:
- After successful renter access, create a short-lived session (server-side) tied to:
  - renter_access_token (random, stored hashed)
  - rental_id
  - expires_at = rental end_date (or earlier)
- Renter dashboard requires this session/token.
- Token invalid automatically after rental ends.

========================================================
C) VALID ID SCANNING / OCR (OPTIONAL, BUT ARCHITECTED SAFELY)
========================================================
If the system supports scanning ID credentials:
- Provide admin flow to capture ID image at check-in (admin-auth only).
- OCR verification must run server-side via queued job.
- Store:
  - id_type
  - id_number_hash (never store raw number if possible)
  - optional last4 for matching
  - id_scan_file_path (private disk)
- Renter access verification uses stored hashed/partial values.

No API keys in JS/Livewire output. Ever.

========================================================
D) RENTER DASHBOARD
========================================================
Public route:
- GET /renter/access (form)
- POST /renter/access (validate & create session)
- GET /renter/dashboard (requires renter session)
- POST /renter/tickets (requires renter session)
- GET /renter/tickets (requires renter session)

Renter Dashboard content:
1) Rented Unit details:
   - Unit name
   - Unit category/location
   - Rental period start_date to end_date
   - Status: Active / Expired
2) Maintenance Tickets:
   - List of their submitted tickets (status: OPEN/IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED/CLOSED)
   - Create ticket form:
      - category: Cleaning, Plumbing, Electrical, Other
      - subject
      - description
      - optional photo upload (store privately; show thumbnails via temporary signed URLs)
3) Professional notice section:
   - “For urgent concerns, contact front desk at …” (config-driven)

Expired logic:
- If rental expired, dashboard should block ticket creation and show:
  “Your rental period has ended. Ticket submission is unavailable. Please contact the front desk if you need assistance.”

========================================================
E) ADMIN MANAGEMENT OF RENTALS + TICKETS
========================================================
Admin routes (auth protected):
- /admin/rentals
- /admin/rentals/create
- /admin/rentals/{rental}/edit
- /admin/tickets
- /admin/tickets/{ticket}

Admin Rental features:
- Create CONFIRMED rental for a unit:
   - unit_id
   - renter_full_name
   - renter_id_type
   - renter_id_last4 or renter_id_hash
   - rental_reference_code (unique, human-friendly)
   - start_date, end_date
- Prevent overlapping CONFIRMED rentals for same unit.
- Ability to cancel rental (status CANCELLED) -> restores availability.
- On confirm rental, unit becomes RENTED for that period (computed).

Admin Ticket features:
- View tickets (filters by status, unit, date)
- Update ticket status
- Assign to staff (optional)
- Add admin notes (internal only, never shown publicly)

Real-time notifications (admin):
- When a ticket is created, notify admins (broadcast + database notifications).
- When a rental is created/confirmed, optionally notify admins.

========================================================
F) DATABASE TABLES (MANDATORY)
========================================================
1) rentals:
- id
- public_id (ULID) unique indexed
- unit_id fk indexed
- status enum: PENDING/CONFIRMED/CANCELLED
- renter_full_name (string)
- renter_id_type (string)
- renter_id_last4 (string nullable) OR renter_id_hash (string nullable)
- renter_reference_code (string unique indexed) REQUIRED for renter access
- start_date (date indexed)
- end_date (date indexed)
- created_by (admin user_id nullable indexed)
- created_at/updated_at

2) renter_sessions (or renter_access_tokens):
- id
- rental_id fk indexed
- token_hash (string) unique
- expires_at (datetime indexed)
- last_used_at (datetime nullable)
- created_at

3) maintenance_tickets:
- id
- rental_id fk indexed (tie ticket to a rental, not to public user)
- unit_id fk indexed
- status enum: OPEN/IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED/CLOSED default OPEN
- category enum: CLEANING/PLUMBING/ELECTRICAL/OTHER
- subject string
- description text
- attachment_path nullable (private storage)
- created_at/updated_at

4) unit_images as existing
5) audit_logs as existing:
- log creation of rental, ticket creation, status changes

Indexes:
- rentals(unit_id, start_date, end_date, status)
- rentals(renter_reference_code)
- tickets(rental_id, status, created_at)

========================================================
G) AVAILABILITY + OVERLAP CHECK (MANDATORY)
========================================================
Implement overlap detection for CONFIRMED rentals:
Given new [start, end], overlap exists if:
- existing.start <= new.end AND existing.end >= new.start

Prevent creation/confirmation if overlap exists.

========================================================
H) RENTER ACCESS VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
========================================================
On POST /renter/access:
Input validation:
- name required
- id_type required
- reference_code required
- optional last4

Verification steps:
1) Find rental by reference_code
2) Compare normalized renter_full_name (case-insensitive, trimmed)
3) Compare id_type
4) If last4 stored, compare last4 if provided
5) Ensure rental.status = CONFIRMED
6) Ensure today <= end_date (active)
If passes, create renter session token and redirect to /renter/dashboard
If fails or expired, show professional denial message.

Rate limit: 5 attempts per minute per IP.

========================================================
I) LIVEWIRE COMPONENTS (SUGGESTED)
========================================================
Public:
- ShowroomIndex
- UnitShow (gallery + availability)
- RenterAccessForm
- RenterDashboard
- RenterTickets

Admin:
- AdminRentalsIndex + AdminRentalForm
- AdminTicketsIndex + AdminTicketShow
- AdminNotificationsBell

========================================================
J) TESTING (PEST)
========================================================
Write tests for:
- Public showroom shows RENTED when now overlaps CONFIRMED rental (no renter name visible)
- Overlap detection prevents double-booking
- Renter access:
   - valid reference + name + id_type grants session
   - expired rental denies with correct message
   - wrong data denies
   - rate limiting triggers
- Renter dashboard requires renter session token
- Ticket creation works for active rental; blocked for expired rental
- Admin can view and update tickets
- Notifications fired on ticket creation (Notification::fake)

========================================================
K) README
========================================================
Document:
- How admin creates rentals and reference codes
- How renter access works (no accounts)
- Ticketing workflow
- Security notes:
   - no API keys client-side
   - ID scan stored privately
   - rate limiting enabled

Deliver clean code with migrations, models, controllers/services, Livewire components, policies/middleware, and passing Pest tests.
